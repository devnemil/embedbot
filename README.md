# EmbedBot
This is a Discord Bot I created to send embedded messages with commands! Written in Discord.js 12

# Setup
Before downloading the bot files, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Then download the repo to your computer.
Run `npm install`
Open the config.json file and modify it to your configuration.
Finally, run **Startbot.bat** and the bot should start up!

# Use for REPLIT.COM uptime
```const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'));

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`));```
