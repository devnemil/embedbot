# EmbedBot
This is a Discord Bot I created to send embedded messages with commands! Written in Discord.js 12

# Setup
Before downloading the bot files, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Then download the repo to your computer.
Run `npm install`
Open the config.json file and modify it to your configuration.
Finally, run **Startbot.bat** and the bot should start up!
